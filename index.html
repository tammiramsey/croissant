    <h1>Croissants - A Pastry for All!</h1>

    <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of
        the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.
    </p>

    <p>Making croissants do not require fancy kitchen equipment or special ingredients,
        but they do require patience, a rolling pin, and plenty of time. Especially if it's
        your first time making croissants. If you can read and follow directions, then you
        well on your way to making your own batch of these well-loved French pastries.
